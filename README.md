# StudyAppv5
> _The fifth (and hopefully final) rebirth of the MSSA project_
>
> The StudyApp is an intuitive flashcard application created as a final project for the Fort Bragg Microsoft Software and Systems Academy Cohort 8. The first 4 versions of this project produced varius bugs that were more easily solved by rebuilding. The first two of those can be found here: https://github.com/mmmoore13/study-project.git. 

## Purpose
### The grand aim of the Study App is to provide the user with this experience:
> - A comprehensive social media app that maps an individuals knowledge and executable experience in all aspects of human knowledge as well as their comprehension of those fields. The aim of the app is not to discriminate against those who have not learned or acquired knowledge/experience, it is to level the functional playing field among individuals in the work force. The app will also have instructions and lessons for every point of knowledge, and automatically cause you to study anything you have either learned or tested proficient in at appropriate intervals. The App will be broken into 2 parts: *Knowledge* and *Experience*.
>
> - *Knowledge* will initially be the mapping of wrote academic information, but evolve into the objective breakdown of all experiences into finite and testable increments.
> 
> - *Experience* will be the mapping of skill sets, or practices that are not easily encapsulated by simple multiple choice questions. This section will be comprised of videos and 3d modules designed to both instruct users on how to complete the skill/task at hand as well as show what skills they have.

### A Bit More Rationally...
> The StudyApp is a user built and defined flashcard program that facilitates memorization of study material through appropriately timed review and repetition, guided by a metric that tracks how long a user remembers an answer.
